# Omarchy

A personalized fork of [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) - a beautiful, modern & opinionated Linux distribution based on Arch Linux.

## What is This?

This is a customized version of Omarchy with a curated selection of pre-installed applications tailored to my specific workflow and preferences. While the original Omarchy comes with a comprehensive set of productivity tools and web apps, this fork provides a more focused, streamlined experience.

## Key Differences from Official Omarchy

### Removed Applications
- Productivity Suite: Typora, Google Calendar
- Communication: Signal, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, Basecamp, Hey, X
- Media: Spotify, KDenLive, Google Photos, YouTube
- Security: 1Password
- AI: Grok, ChatGPT

### Modified Keybindings
All keybindings have been updated to match the new application set. Press `Super + K` to view all available shortcuts.
